# Writing

_I have added a password to few of the worksheets above. If the pdf asks for a password, here is a tip for you: It means "passwordless" in Turkish. But write it without Turkish characters like -*ÅŸ*- and use instead -*s*_-
The reason why I have added a password is that some worksheets above were the ones I prepared for my classes during our online education or class study. So, I prefred to protect them with such a simple and fool password. Yet, I have helped you and already given the tip :smile:
